/*********************************************************************************************************************************
* The General Idea behind this is that there's some kind of console or gui interface that allows the game master.
* to enter data for each player and send it out assuming the player's actually attempting to connect
* So order of operations in a basic form is. Game Master fills out form for each player in a json or some other format. 
* Or it's not serialized and that data only exists per session. Either way it's entered and saved in system.
* Player suit sends out hello packet with ID, laser frequency and sensor capabilities? Probably for debug mode at least
* Server responds back with a welcome packet that contains string name of player. Color and associated team if team battle mode.
* Score counter zeroed out. Status of game room and lobby. Game mode if suit needs to be aware for some reason. 
* Server sends out packet to start once timer for lobby or start game has been initiated
